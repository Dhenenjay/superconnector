```
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=superconnector_verify_2024
```

**Option B:** Update your Twilio/WhatsApp webhook verification token to:
```
superconnector_verify_2024
```

### 2. Update Twilio Webhook URL
Update your Twilio WhatsApp sandbox or production number webhook to:
```
https://superconnector-backend-klye.onrender.com/webhook/whatsapp
```

### 3. Update VAPI Webhook URL  
Configure your VAPI assistant webhook to:
```
https://superconnector-backend-klye.onrender.com/webhook/vapi
```

## 🎯 What's Working Now

1. **WhatsApp Integration**
   - Receives and processes messages
   - Handles greetings and conversations
   - Supports emoji in responses
   - Manages user profiles in Convex

2. **Call Management**
   - Initiates VAPI calls on request
   - Stores call records in database
   - Retrieves call history for users
   - Processes call summaries from VAPI

3. **AI Integration**
   - Uses OpenAI for intelligent responses
   - Context-aware conversation handling
   - Personalized responses based on user profile

## 📝 Environment Variables Confirmed
