## Fix #1: VAPI API Key (URGENT)

The error "Invalid Key. Hot tip, you may be using the private key instead of the public key" means:

### You need to use the PUBLIC API key, not the PRIVATE key!

1. Go to: https://dashboard.vapi.ai/
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Look for **PUBLIC KEY** (not private!)
4. Copy the PUBLIC key
5. Update in Render:
   - Environment Variable: `VAPI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your PUBLIC key (starts with different prefix than private)

## Fix #2: OpenAI API Key

The OpenAI key appears to be truncated or invalid.

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key if needed
3. Copy the FULL key (starts with `sk-`)
4. Update in Render:
   - Environment Variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your complete OpenAI key

## Fix #3: VAPI Phone Number ID

Make sure this is correct:
1. Go to VAPI Dashboard ‚Üí Phone Numbers
2. Find your phone number
3. Copy the Phone Number ID (not the phone number itself!)
4. Update in Render:
   - Environment Variable: `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER`
   - Value: The ID (like `8b427031-9c9e-44d9-afda-6a6e2a23e3c3`)

## Update in Render

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Update these variables:
   - `VAPI_API_KEY` = Your VAPI **PUBLIC** key
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = Your complete OpenAI key
   - `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER` = Your VAPI phone number ID

5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Service will auto-redeploy
